# PacMan-V2
Version 2 of PacMan

<p>Although the original Pacman I made "Works" I've decided the only way to a proper game is rework the ghost algorithm, and to remake the game from the ground up, the way it should have been made from the start. </p>

<p>I would like to personally thank the author of this article: https://www.codesdope.com/blog/article/backtracking-to-solve-a-rat-in-a-maze-c-java-pytho/ </p>
<p>This article was used as the base of my ghost pathfinding algorithm</p>

<p>I would like to personally thank 'Retro Game Mechanics Explained' for the video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ataGotQ7ir8</p>
<p>This video was used to improve the ghost pathfinding algorithm, and ghost states, along with many otyher things</p>
